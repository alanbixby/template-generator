A personal TypeScript template generator.

Install:

```bash
npm i -g @alanbixby/template-generator
```

Executable can be run as `txb`, `txp`, `templategen`, or `template-gen`.

> Its a personal package, I can pollute the namespace as much as I want- bite me.

For those of you finding this package through the Beyond Fireship comment, I strongly recommend you fork and publish this as your own package. I can and will modify this without warning.

```
--name [package_name] : sets the name to be used in the package
  alias --projectName
  alias
--force : overwrite if the folder already exists
  alias -f
--default : Use all default options, initialize the repo and download NPM dependencies.
  alias --skip
  alias -y
```
